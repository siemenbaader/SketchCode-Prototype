Aspects of coding to improve:
=============================
    - add interactivity (whole & piecemeal)
    - add material qualities through representations
    - add explorativity thru versioning
    - encourage refining


Backlog
=======
* Deal with hiliting text area (eg remove) OK
* Make a sample app
  - eg a small menu

* Entity display (AST mode)
  - defining entities in text
  - insert entities into code
  - editing text code & entity content

* Entity interaction
  - load & REPL inteties
  - define closure vars for entities
  - define other aspects of entities; eg benchmark

* In-Place entity editing
  - merge rich text editor / make all panels rich editing
  - entity inserting
  - use already defined entites in the declaration of new ones

* (IDE panel)
  - IDE panel to extend the IDE from the browser

* Exploration History
  - sequential
  - checkouts
  - persisting
  - branching
  - labelling
  - colordiff views

* App Logging console

* Multiple files support



TODAY TODO
==========

* Can I make local style defs inside an element?
  - use externally linked sheets pr concept then


* History
  - no commit on errors
  - catch & show exception in App window
  - delete individual commits
  - commit code & defs editors

  Later
  - persist to disk function
  - persist all state (now is only innerHTML)

* Entity insertion
  - one hardcoded entity for definitions
  - SHIFT+ENTER to trigger menu & show all defs

* Entity interaction


* Make sample abstraction

=========================

* Have an intention interaction window that can open
* defining intentions from the intentions editor works
* need to look at intention format to see if they can be 
  a. serialized & saved to localStorage
  b. be DOM elements themselves
  c. if they can be shown in different places at the same time. clone?


Missing
=======


Morning:

* REPL fixup: Adding intention to REPL view, positioning: overflow: auto vs visible!
* REPL action
* interaction shineup - CTRL-keys etc
* persisting
* fake history
* History cleanup & labels
* eval err background

* make a good example intention - state machine?


Afternoon: 
* presentation outline
* Slides & lego
